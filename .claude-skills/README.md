## Overview

**Claude Skills for Intelligent Textbooks** is a comprehensive collection of AI-powered skills and workflows designed to revolutionize educational content creation. Built with Claude AI and optimized for intelligent textbook development, this repository provides educators and content creators with powerful tools to generate interactive, standards-based educational materials at scale.

This project enables the creation of **Level 2+ intelligent textbooks** using MkDocs with the Material theme, incorporating learning graphs, concept dependencies, interactive p5.js simulations (MicroSims), and AI-assisted content generation. Every skill follows educational best practices including Bloom's Taxonomy (2001 revision) for learning outcomes, ISO 11179 standards for terminology definitions, and concept dependency graphs to ensure proper prerequisite sequencing.

Whether you're an educator building course materials, a technical writer creating documentation, or a developer interested in educational technology, these Claude skills provide a systematic, AI-powered approach to creating comprehensive, interactive educational content. The skills can generate everything from foundational learning graphs with 200+ concepts to interactive quizzes, glossaries, FAQs, and engaging simulations—all following rigorous quality standards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic familiarity with markdown and command line

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmccreary/claude-skills.git
cd claude-skills
```

### Install Dependencies

This project uses MkDocs with the Material theme:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install pymdown-extensions
```

### Build and Serve Locally

Build the documentation site:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

Serve locally for development (with live reload):

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This will build the site and push it to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Using the Skills

**Option 1: Global Installation (All Projects)**

Create symlinks to make skills available globally:

```bash
cd scripts
./install-claude-skills.sh
```

This installs skills to `~/.claude/skills/` for use across all Claude Code projects.

**Option 2: Project-Specific Installation**

Skills in this repository are automatically available when working within this project directory.

**Invoke a skill in Claude Code:**

```
Use the learning-graph-generator skill to create a concept graph for my course
```

Or use the slash command:

```
/skill learning-graph-generator
```

**List available skills:**

```bash
./scripts/list-skills.sh
```

### Using the Documentation Site

**Navigation:**

- Use the left sidebar to browse chapters and skill descriptions
- Click the search icon (🔍) to search all content
- Each chapter includes quizzes for self-assessment
- The Learning Graph section shows concept dependencies and quality metrics

**Interactive MicroSims:**

- Found in the "MicroSims" section of the documentation
- Each simulation runs standalone in your browser
- Adjust parameters with sliders and interactive controls
- View source code and customize for your own use

**Customization:**

- Edit markdown files in `docs/` to modify content
- Modify `mkdocs.yml` to change site structure and navigation
- Add your own MicroSims in `docs/sims/[microsim-name]/`
- Customize theme colors and styles in `docs/css/extra.css`
- Create custom skills in `skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
