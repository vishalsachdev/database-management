## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Add 10-12 Questions)

Focus on **Critical Gaps** to improve coverage from 64% to 75%:

1. Add questions for Concepts 1, 2, 3 (AI Fundamentals)
2. Add questions for Concepts 176, 177, 178, 179 (Prompt Engineering)
3. Add questions for Concepts 122, 124, 140 (Resource Generation)
4. Add questions for Concepts 64, 70 (Learning Graph Processes)

These 11 additions would cover the highest-priority gaps and significantly improve FAQ utility.

### Short-Term Actions (Add 8-10 More Questions)

Address remaining **Critical Gaps** and top **Medium Priority Gaps**:

1. Taxonomy concepts (93, 94, 96, 98)
2. Quiz design concepts (141, 142)
3. Graph quality metrics (86, 87, 89)

### Long-Term Maintenance

- **Review quarterly:** Check for new concepts added to learning graph
- **User feedback:** Track which topics generate support requests
- **Analytics:** If chatbot JSON is deployed, monitor which questions get asked
- **Update after course changes:** Revise FAQ when course content or structure changes

## Coverage Improvement Strategy

**Target Coverage:** 75-80% (150-160 concepts of 200)

**Current Coverage:** 64% (128 concepts)

**Gap to Target:** 22-32 additional concepts

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate):** Add 11 critical gap questions → 69% coverage
2. **Phase 2 (Short-term):** Add 10 medium priority questions → 74% coverage
3. **Phase 3 (Long-term):** Add 6-11 selective low priority questions → 77-80% coverage

**Rationale for 75-80% target:**

- Covers all high and medium centrality concepts
- Leaves very specialized/technical details for documentation
- Maintains FAQ usability (too many questions reduces discoverability)
- Focuses on user needs rather than exhaustive coverage

## Conclusion

The current FAQ provides solid coverage (64%) of core concepts with excellent depth in Claude Skills, learning graphs, MkDocs, and educational theory. The main gaps are in:

1. **AI Fundamentals** (prompt engineering, LLMs, AI basics)
2. **Resource Generation** (quiz and glossary skill details)
3. **Learning Graph Processes** (specific workflows for generation)
4. **Advanced Techniques** (prompt refinement, optimization)

Adding 11 questions addressing critical gaps would bring coverage to ~69%, providing comprehensive support for most user needs. Further additions targeting medium priority gaps could achieve 75-80% coverage, representing excellent FAQ completeness for a professional development course.
