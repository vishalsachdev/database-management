## Priority Matrix for Skill Development

Prioritization based on **Impact** (frequency of use) vs. **Effort** (similarity to existing MicroSims).

### Priority Scores

| Rank | Type | Count | Impact (0-10) | Effort (0-10) | Priority Score | Status |
|------|------|-------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | **microsim** | 8 | 3.5 | 0 | 3.48 | ✅ Exists |
| 2 | **diagram** | 23 | 10 | 4 | 2.5 | 🔨 Build |
| 3 | **infographic** | 11 | 4.8 | 2 | 2.39 | 🔨 Build |
| 4 | **workflow** | 16 | 7.0 | 6 | 1.16 | 🔨 Build |
| 5 | **chart** | 9 | 3.9 | 5 | 0.78 | 🔨 Build |
| 6 | **graph-model** | 1 | 0.4 | 1 | 0.43 | 🔨 Build |
| 7 | **markdown-table** | 4 | 1.7 | 5 | 0.35 | 🔨 Build |
| 8 | **timeline** | 3 | 1.3 | 7 | 0.19 | 🔨 Build |
| 9 | **unknown** | 1 | 0.4 | 5 | 0.09 | 🔨 Build |

### Interpretation

- **Impact**: Higher values indicate more instances of this visualization type across chapters
- **Effort**: Higher values indicate more development effort required (less similar to existing MicroSims)
- **Priority Score**: Impact/Effort ratio - higher scores suggest better ROI for skill development
