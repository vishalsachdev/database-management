For Python, the course provides pre-built scripts (analyze-graph.py, csv-to-json.py, etc.) that you run as-is, and basic understanding of running Python commands is helpful. For JavaScript/p5.js, the microsim-p5 skill generates simulation code for you, and understanding basic JavaScript helps customize simulations, but isn't required for core functionality.

Skills are invoked with '/skill [name]' and run specialized workflows like generating learning graphs or creating glossaries. Claude Commands are simpler prompt expansions defined in markdown files.

Each concept is a node, and directed edges represent dependencies (concept A must be learned before concept B). Key characteristics include 200 concepts for comprehensive course coverage, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure with dependencies flowing in one direction with no circular loops, taxonomy categories grouping concepts by theme, and prerequisite tracking ensuring proper learning sequence.

Glossary definitions following ISO 11179 must be precise (exact meaning without ambiguity), concise (minimal words while conveying full meaning), distinct (clearly differentiated from related terms), non-circular (don't define terms using themselves), and free of business rules (no implementation details or procedures).

You can adjust this number based on course scope: introductory courses (100-150 concepts), comprehensive courses (200-250 concepts), graduate-level courses (250-300 concepts).

Chapter components include introduction (overview and learning objectives), prerequisites (required prior knowledge with links), core content (3-7 major sections), worked examples (2-3 detailed examples), practice exercises (5-8 exercises at varying Bloom's levels), summary (key takeaways as bullet list), and further reading (optional advanced resources). Each chapter should address 10-20 related concepts from the learning graph, respecting dependency order. Target 2,000-5,000 words per chapter for comprehensive coverage without overwhelming readers. The book-chapter-generator skill automatically creates chapter structure based on learning graph dependencies.",

Use manual creation for creative examples (domain-specific scenarios and analogies), nuanced explanations (complex concepts requiring expert insight), custom visualizations (unique diagrams tailored to specific content), refinement (editing AI-generated content for tone, accuracy, and clarity), and domain expertise (subject matter that requires specialized knowledge).

Integration approach options include inline (embed within chapter content where concept is introduced), supplementary (link to MicroSim page for optional exploration), and progressive (start with simple sims in early chapters, advance complexity later).

After course delivery, revise based on student feedback about prerequisite gaps, assessment data showing struggling points, and new topics to add or outdated content to remove.
