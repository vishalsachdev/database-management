## Category Distribution Guidelines

- Target: ~16-17 concepts per category (200 concepts ÷ 12 categories)
- Maximum: 30% of total concepts (~60 concepts)
- Minimum: 5% of total concepts (~10 concepts)
- Use **MISC** for concepts that don't fit clearly into defined categories

## Notes

This taxonomy provides a balanced organization of course concepts across technical, pedagogical, and practical domains. Categories are designed to:
1. Avoid excessive overlap
2. Maintain clear boundaries
3. Support logical learning progressions
4. Enable effective visualization with distinct colors
5. Align with the course structure and learning outcomes
