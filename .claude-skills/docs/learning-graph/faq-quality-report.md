## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

Actual vs Target:

| Level | Actual | Target | Deviation | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Remember | 6 (9.4%) | 20% | -10.6% | ⚠ |
| Understand | 22 (34.4%) | 30% | +4.4% | ✓ |
| Apply | 19 (29.7%) | 25% | +4.7% | ✓ |
| Analyze | 7 (10.9%) | 15% | -4.1% | ✓ |
| Evaluate | 6 (9.4%) | 7% | +2.4% | ✓ |
| Create | 4 (6.3%) | 3% | +3.3% | ✓ |

**Overall Bloom's Score: 20/25**

**Analysis:** Distribution is generally good with strong coverage of Understand and Apply levels. The Remember level is under-represented (-10.6%) which is acceptable for a professional development course targeting experienced learners. The emphasis on higher-order thinking (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create totaling 56.3%) aligns well with the course's practical, hands-on approach.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding 5-7 more Remember-level questions covering basic terminology and facts to improve distribution, though current emphasis on application is appropriate for the target audience.
