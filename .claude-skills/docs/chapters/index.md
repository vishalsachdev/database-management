## How to Use This Textbook

This textbook follows the natural workflow of creating an intelligent textbook from start to finish. Concepts are carefully sequenced so that each chapter builds on knowledge from previous chapters. All concept dependencies have been validated to ensure a smooth learning progression.

We recommend working through the chapters in order, especially for your first read-through. Later, you can return to specific chapters as reference material when working on particular aspects of your textbook project.
