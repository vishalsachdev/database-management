#### 1. What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes artificial intelligence from traditional rule-based systems?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Faster processing speeds for mathematical calculations
2. Probabilistic reasoning and pattern recognition from data
3. Ability to store larger amounts of information
4. Use of structured programming languages
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Artificial Intelligence represents a paradigm shift from deterministic rule-based systems to probabilistic reasoning, pattern recognition, and emergent behaviors. AI systems learn from experience and adapt to new inputs, rather than simply following pre-programmed rules. Options A and C describe computational improvements rather than fundamental AI capabilities, while option D refers to programming methodology, not AI characteristics.

    **Concept Tested:** Artificial Intelligence

#### 2. What is the fundamental innovation underlying Large Language Models that enables them to process long sequences effectively?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Recurrent neural networks with memory cells
2. Rule-based parsing and grammar trees
3. Self-attention mechanism in transformer architecture
4. Sequential processing of one token at a time
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The self-attention mechanism is the key innovation that allows Large Language Models to weigh the relevance of different parts of the input when processing each token. This architecture enables parallel processing of long sequences and captures both local and global dependencies, overcoming limitations of earlier approaches. Option A describes an older RNN approach that LLMs improved upon, option B is a traditional NLP technique, and option D would be inefficient for modern LLMs.

#### 3. What are the three core principles that guide Anthropic's development of Claude AI?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty
2. Speed, accuracy, and efficiency
3. Scalability, portability, and reliability
4. Innovation, compatibility, and affordability
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Claude AI is designed with a focus on helpfulness (providing useful assistance), harmlessness (reducing potential for generating harmful or biased content), and honesty (transparency about capabilities and limitations). These principles are implemented through constitutional AI during training. Options B, C, and D describe general software engineering or business goals, not Anthropic's specific value alignment principles.

    **Concept Tested:** Claude AI

#### 4. Which statement best describes the relationship between the Five Levels of Textbook Intelligence?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Each level replaces the previous level's capabilities
2. Levels are independent and can be implemented in any order
3. Higher levels require completely different technologies
4. Higher levels include all capabilities of lower levels
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. The Five Levels of Textbook Intelligence are cumulative, meaning each higher level builds upon and includes all capabilities of the lower levels. For example, a Level 3 textbook with interactive elements still maintains the hyperlinked navigation of Level 2 and the content of Level 1. This cumulative architecture ensures that advancing to higher intelligence levels enhances rather than replaces existing functionality.

#### 5. What defines a Level 2 intelligent textbook?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Fixed text with no digital features
2. Hyperlinked navigation with search functionality
3. Interactive simulations and self-grading quizzes
4. AI-powered personalized content generation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Level 2 textbooks introduce hyperlinks, table of contents navigation, search functionality, and internal cross-references. This is the baseline for modern digital textbooks built with platforms like MkDocs. Option A describes Level 1 (static content), option C describes Level 3 (interactive elements), and option D describes Level 5 (AI personalization).

    **Concept Tested:** Level 2: Hyperlinked Navigation

#### 6. Why is the Claude Code interface particularly well-suited for intelligent textbook creation compared to the general Claude.ai web interface?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It provides better natural language understanding
2. It uses more advanced AI models
3. It integrates with file systems and can execute multi-step workflows
4. It has a simpler user interface for beginners
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Claude Code provides file system access, command execution, context awareness of project structure, and the ability to execute complex sequences of operations autonomously. These capabilities are essential for reading course descriptions, generating multiple chapters, creating interactive elements, and maintaining consistency across a textbook project. Options A and B are incorrect as both interfaces use the same underlying models, and option D mischaracterizes Claude Code, which is actually more complex but more powerful for development tasks.

#### 7. What is the primary purpose of providing comprehensive context in prompts for educational content generation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To make the prompt longer and more impressive
2. To ensure consistency and alignment with project goals
3. To test the AI's ability to process large amounts of text
4. To reduce the need for human review
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Providing comprehensive context (course description, learning graph, existing chapters, target audience) ensures that AI-generated content maintains consistency across the entire textbook and aligns with educational objectives. Claude Code's extended context window enables loading entire project contexts, which is essential for coherent multi-chapter development. Option A misunderstands the purpose of context, option C describes a test rather than a practical goal, and option D is misleading as human review remains important.

#### 8. A textbook allows students to adjust sliders to see how changing parameters affects a graph visualization, and includes self-grading quizzes with immediate feedback. What level of textbook intelligence does this represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Level 3: Interactive Elements
2. Level 2: Hyperlinked Navigation
3. Level 4: Adaptive Content
4. Level 5: AI Personalization
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Level 3 textbooks incorporate interactive visualizations (like the parameter sliders affecting graphs) and self-assessment tools (self-grading quizzes) directly embedded in the content. This provides interactivity and immediate feedback but does not yet adapt the learning pathway based on student performance (which would be Level 4) or generate personalized explanations (which would be Level 5). Level 2 would only have navigation features without interactivity.

#### 9. What is the underlying reason that Large Language Models are effective for educational content creation, as opposed to just being good at text generation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They can type faster than humans
2. They have memorized all textbooks
3. They never make mistakes in grammar
4. They can understand and apply pedagogical frameworks consistently
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. The chapter explains that LLMs' ability to understand educational frameworks like Bloom's Taxonomy and apply them consistently across large document sets makes them valuable partners in curriculum development. They can generate pedagogically structured content aligned with learning objectives and maintain consistency—capabilities that go beyond simple text generation. Option A is trivial and irrelevant, option B mischaracterizes how LLMs work (they don't memorize), and option C is false as LLMs can make errors.

#### 10. Which of the following is a key component that should be included in educational content prompts?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Personal opinions about the subject matter
2. Vague suggestions for improvement
3. Explicit learning objectives and concept coverage lists
4. Requests for the shortest possible output
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Educational content prompts should include explicit learning objectives (clearly stated goals for what learners should understand or be able to do) and concept coverage verification (complete lists of concepts that must be addressed). This ensures the AI generates educationally sound content aligned with course goals. Option A introduces bias, option B lacks the specificity needed for quality output, and option D contradicts the need for comprehensive educational content.
