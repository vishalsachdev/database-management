# Details Skills Impact Analysis

I now need to understand more about the content inside all the
 details tags.  I need to build a skill for each type of detail - infographic, network drawing etc. 
 Can you create a new metrics report that categorizes these details components?  This will help me 
prioritize what skills to build next.  Ideally I would like a 2D chart that has impact on the 
vertical axis and effor on the horizontal axis.  The effort would be how similar the new details are
 to my existing microsims. 

# Response

Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

  Summary

  I've created a comprehensive Details Tag Content Analysis that categorizes all 57 <details> tags
  in your chapters and provides a priority matrix for skill development.

  Key Findings:

  Distribution of Visualization Types:
  1. diagram - 15 instances (26.3%) - General diagrams
  2. graph-model - 10 instances (17.5%) - Graph-based interactive models
  3. chart - 9 instances (15.8%) - Charts and graphs
  4. workflow - 7 instances (12.3%) - Process/workflow visualizations
  5. infographic - 5 instances (8.8%) - Infographics
  6. microsim - 5 instances (8.8%) - Already implemented!

  Priority Recommendations (Impact vs. Effort):

  🏆 Top Priority - High Impact, Low Effort:
  1. graph-model (10 instances, score 6.67)
    - Very similar to your existing graph viewer
    - Examples: IT Asset Relationship Graph, Multi-Layer Dependency Map
  2. diagram (15 instances, score 2.5)
    - Most frequent type
    - Medium similarity to existing work
    - Examples: ITIL Framework Structure, CMDB Data Flow Architecture
  3. chart (9 instances, score 1.2)
    - Good frequency
    - Examples: Performance comparison charts, timeline charts
  4. infographic (5 instances, score 1.67)
    - Similar to your p5-infographic-template
    - Examples: IT Asset Hierarchy, Application Portfolio Quadrant

  The Report Includes:

  - Visual 2D matrix showing Impact (Y-axis) vs. Effort (X-axis)
  - Quadrant analysis grouping types by priority
  - Detailed breakdown of every <details> tag with chapter, summary, purpose, and learning
  objectives
  - Specific examples for each visualization type

  The analysis suggests focusing first on graph-model skills since they have the highest ROI (10
  instances, very similar to your existing graph viewer MicroSim).

  The report is now accessible at /docs/details-analysis.md and has been added to your mkdocs
  navigation!
