# Prompt to Create a Chapter Generator

!!! prompt
    Use the skill-creator skill to create a new skill called `book-chapter-generator`.
    This skill will look at the following resources:

    ## Input Resources
    1. Course Description at /docs/course-description.md
    2. Learning Graph at /docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.json
    3. Concept Taxonomy at /docs/learning-graph/concept-taxonomy.md

    ## Step 1: Design Chapters

    It will then suggest an outline of about 12 chapters for this book assuming you have about 200 concepts to cover.
    Each chapter will have a Chapter Title in Title Case and be no longer than 200 characters long.
    This is so that the listing of the chapters can fit on a single line per chapter.
    Use the course description and the learning graph to make sure that

    1. Each concept is covered once
    2. No concept is introduced before its dependencies are covered
    3. No chapter contains too many or two few concepts

    You may, at your discretion have as few as six chapters, or as many as 20 chapters.

    ## Step 2: Present Chapter Design to the User

    Present a simple list of Chapter Titles to the user.  Only present the
    Chapter Titles and a single sentence of what that chapter contains.
    You may also discuss any challenges you found and how your design met these challenges.

    Ask the user if they approve the design (y/n) and if no, what changes they want to make.

    ## Step 3: Generate the Chapter Outline Files

    For each chapter, create a "URL-PATH-NAME" which is only lowercase letters and dashes. Do not put any special characters in the URL-PATH-NAME.  Use abbreviations if you need to keep the URL-PATH-NAME short.

    Create a series of directories using the following structure where URL-PATH-NAME is the name for each chapter.

    ```
    chapters/index.md
    chapters/01-URL-PATH-NAME/index.md
    chapters/02-URL-PATH-NAME/index.md
    chapters/03-URL-PATH-NAME/index.md
    ```

    ## Step 4: Add Content to the Index of Each Chapter

    Add content to each chapter index.md file including:

    1. The Chapter Title in a level 1 header
    2. A summary of what is in the chapter in a level 2 ## Summary section
    3. A numbered markdown list of concepts in a level 2 ## Concepts Covered section
    4. A 'TODO: Generate Chapter Content" which will be used by a future skill

  Design Challenges & Solutions:

  Challenge: The course has three major concept domains (ITIL/CMDB legacy, RDBMS fundamentals, Graph
   databases) that must be taught in sequence
  Solution: Structured the first 5 chapters as a clear progression from legacy (Ch 1-2) through
  relational databases (Ch 3) to graph fundamentals (Ch 4-5)

  Challenge: Graph operations (GOPS category) has 23 concepts with complex inter-dependencies
  Solution: Dedicated Chapter 6 entirely to graph traversal and dependency analysis after
  establishing graph fundamentals in Chapters 4-5

  Challenge: Data management (DATA category) contains 26 concepts spanning quality, governance, and
  operational concerns
  Solution: Concentrated these in Chapter 8 after covering business services (Ch 7) so students
  understand the context for why data quality matters

  Challenge: Several advanced topics (AI, transformation, operations) needed to come late but are
  spread across different taxonomy categories
  Solution: Combined AI & Analytics, Transformation, Data Validation, and Operations concepts into
  Chapter 12 as "Advanced Topics" since they all build on earlier concepts

  Challenge: Balancing chapter sizes while respecting dependencies
  Solution: Most chapters have 12-23 concepts (optimal range), with only Chapter 2 (7 concepts) and
  Chapter 5 (8 concepts) slightly below target, but these serve as important transitional chapters

  Challenge: Ensuring observability concepts come after monitoring fundamentals
  Solution: Placed observability in Chapter 10 after establishing operational contexts in earlier
  chapters

  Statistics:

  - Total chapters: 12
  - Average concepts per chapter: 16.7
  - Range: 7-26 concepts per chapter
  - All 200 concepts covered: ✓
  - All dependencies respected: ✓
