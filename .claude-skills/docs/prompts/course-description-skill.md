toking limits, 4-hour windows, pro version of claude, course descriptions, 
2001 bloom taxonomy, shell scripts, python programs, pip, mkdocs, 
mkdocs-material theme 

⏺ Excellent list of topics! Now for the final question:

  What are the learning outcomes organized by the 2001 Bloom's Taxonomy?

  After this course, students will be able to demonstrate competencies at
  each level. Please provide specific learning outcomes for each of the six
  levels:

  Remember - Retrieve, recognize, and recall relevant knowledge
  (e.g., "List the main components of a Claude skill", "Recall the six
  levels of Bloom's Taxonomy")

  Understand - Construct meaning from instructional messages
  (e.g., "Explain how learning graphs connect concepts", "Describe the
  purpose of MkDocs Material theme")

  Apply - Carry out or use procedures in given situations
  (e.g., "Use Claude to generate a glossary", "Apply prompt engineering
  techniques")

  Analyze - Break material into parts and determine relationships
  (e.g., "Analyze the dependencies between concepts in a learning graph",
  "Compare different skill packaging approaches")

  Evaluate - Make judgments based on criteria and standards
  (e.g., "Assess the quality of a course description", "Evaluate the
  effectiveness of a generated learning graph")

  Create - Put elements together to form coherent wholes; includes capstone
  projects
  (e.g., "Design and publish a custom Claude skill", "Create a complete
  intelligent textbook for a course")

  Please provide multiple specific outcomes for each level.

> remember the steps in creating an intelligent textbook, remember what a 
claude skill is, rember the steps to install a claude skill, remember the 
steps to install a claude command, remember how to list claude skills, 
understand how skills are used, understand how skills are created, understand
 what skills intelligent textbooks need, understand the order skills should 
be run, apply prompt engeering to create a skill, apply the skill creator 
skill to create a new skill, apply the command creations steps to create new 
commands, analyse the result of a skill execution, analyse the quality of 
content generated by a skill, analize the compleatness of a document such as 
a course description, analyse if a skill needs to be improved, analyse why 
skills do not install correctly, analyze if quality reports are working, 
create new skills, create new intelligent textbooks, create new commands 

⏺ Great! I have outcomes for Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, and
  Create.

  I notice we're missing outcomes for the Evaluate level - Make judgments
  based on criteria and standards.

  Could you provide some learning outcomes for the Evaluate level?

  For example:
  - "Evaluate the quality of a generated course description against scoring
  criteria"
  - "Assess the effectiveness of a skill's documentation"
  - "Judge whether a learning graph has sufficient concept coverage"

  What evaluation outcomes would you like students to achieve?

> evaluate the quality of a course description, evaluate the quality of a 
skill, evaluate the quality of a book, evaluate the quality of a book 
announcement, evaluate the quality of preview images for social media posts

  Gap Analysis

  Minor Weaknesses Identified:

  1. Understand Level (8/10): Currently has 4 outcomes. Adding 1-2 more would
   strengthen this section. Consider adding outcomes like:
    - "Understand the relationship between learning graphs and concept
  dependencies"
    - "Explain the role of Bloom's Taxonomy in intelligent textbook design"
  2. Apply Level (7/10): Currently has 3 outcomes. Adding 2-3 more would
  provide better coverage. Consider adding outcomes like:
    - "Apply MkDocs Material theme to create professional documentation"
    - "Use Git for version control of textbook content"
    - "Execute shell scripts to automate textbook generation workflows"

  Improvement Suggestions

  Priority 1 - Enhance Bloom's Taxonomy Coverage:
  - Add 1-2 more Understand outcomes focusing on conceptual relationships
  - Add 2-3 more Apply outcomes focusing on tool usage and practical
  procedures

  Priority 2 - Strengthen Technical Depth:
  - Consider adding specific outcomes about graph databases and algorithms
  - Include outcomes about MkDocs configuration and customization
  - Add outcomes about debugging and troubleshooting skills

  Priority 3 - Optional Enhancements:
  - Consider adding expected time commitment or course duration
  - Optionally include assessment methods or success criteria

  Concept Generation Readiness Assessment

  Estimated Concept Count Potential: 250-300 concepts

  The course description demonstrates excellent readiness for generating 200+
   concepts:

  ✓ Topic Breadth: 20+ major topics provide diverse concept sources✓ Topic 
  Depth: Topics span from basic (installation) to advanced (graph
  algorithms)✓ Bloom's Taxonomy: All six levels represented with 41 total
  outcomes✓ Clear Scope: Boundaries well-defined with excluded topics✓
  Practical Focus: Strong emphasis on hands-on, applicable skills

  Concept Categories Supported:
  - Technical skills (Git, VS Code, terminal, Python, shell scripts)
  - Claude-specific knowledge (skills, commands, usage limits)
  - Educational design (learning graphs, Bloom's Taxonomy, course
  descriptions)
  - Content creation (textbooks, documentation, interactive content)
  - Quality assurance (testing, evaluation, analysis)

    Should I add course description to the navigation?

    Yes

    I'll add the course description to the navigation in mkdocs.yml after the
    About section.

    ⏺ Read(mkdocs.yml)
    ⎿  Read 66 lines

    ⏺ Update(mkdocs.yml)
    ⎿  Updated mkdocs.yml with 1 addition                   
            9    nav:
        10      - Home: index.md
        11      - About: about.md
        12 +    - Course Description: course-description.md
        13      - Getting Started: getting-started.md
        14      - List of Skills: 
        15        - Overview: list-of-skills.md

    ⏺ Done! I've added the "Course Description" navigation item after "About" in
    mkdocs.yml. The navigation now shows:

    - Home
    - About
    - Course Description (new)
    - Getting Started
    - List of Skills
    - ...

    The course-description.md file will now appear in the site navigation
    between About and Getting Started.

  Next Steps

  ✓ Ready to proceed with learning graph generation!

  Your course description scored 95/100 and contains excellent coverage
  across all required elements. While minor improvements to the Understand
  and Apply levels would further strengthen the document, the current version
   provides more than sufficient detail to generate a comprehensive learning
  graph with 200+ concepts.

  Recommended Actions:
  1. Optional: Add 3-5 more outcomes to Understand and Apply levels for even
  better concept coverage
  2. Proceed: Use the learning-graph-generator skill to create your learning
  graph
  3. Continue Workflow: After the learning graph, proceed with glossary,
  chapter content, quizzes, and FAQs

  The course description successfully captures the breadth and depth needed
  for an intelligent textbook on using Claude Skills for educational content
  creation.
