> use the infographic-generator-p5 to create a new infographic from the following 
description: <summary>Course Description Quality Impact on Workflow</summary>
    Type: workflow

    Purpose: Show how course description quality affects subsequent skill outputs

    Visual style: Flowchart with quality branching

    Steps:
    1. Start: "Course Description Created"

    2. Decision: "Quality Score ≥ 70?"
       Hover text: "Assessed using course-description-analyzer skill"

    3a. High Quality Path (Score ≥ 70):
        - Process: "Learning graph generation"
          Hover text: "200 relevant concepts with accurate dependencies"
        - Process: "Glossary generation"
          Hover text: "Precise definitions aligned with concepts"
        - Process: "Chapter structure"
          Hover text: "Logical sequencing respecting prerequisites"
        - Result: "High-quality textbook with minimal manual correction"

    3b. Low Quality Path (Score < 70):
        - Process: "Learning graph generation"
          Hover text: "Generic or off-target concepts, unclear dependencies"
        - Process: "Manual correction required"
          Hover text: "Significant effort to refine concepts and relationships"
        - Process: "Regenerate downstream artifacts"
          Hover text: "Glossary, chapters must be redone with corrected graph"
        - Result: "Extended development time, inconsistent quality"

    Annotations:
    - "Investing time in course description quality pays exponential dividends"
    - "Quality threshold: 70+ for acceptable, 85+ for excellent"

    Color coding:
    - Green: High-quality path
    - Orange: Low-quality path requiring rework
    - Blue: Assessment and decision points

⏺ I'll use the infographic-generator-p5 skill to create this workflow diagram showing how
   course description quality impacts the entire textbook development process.

⏺ I found the infographic-generator-p5 skill! This will create a p5.js-based interactive
  flowchart showing how course description quality impacts the textbook development
  workflow. Let me create this for you.

⏺ Now I'll create the infographic. First, let me plan the node structure:

  - Start node (gray): "Course Description Created"
  - Decision node (blue, diamond): "Quality Score ≥ 70?"
  - High Quality Path (green): Learning graph → Glossary → Chapter structure →
  High-quality textbook
  - Low Quality Path (orange): Learning graph → Manual correction → Regenerate artifacts
  → Extended development time

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully created the Course Description Quality Impact on Workflow
  infographic using the infographic-generator-p5 skill. Here's what was generated:

  Created Files

  All files are in /docs/sims/course-quality-workflow/:

  1. data.json - Node and edge data with 10 nodes representing the workflow:

    - 1 decision node (Quality Score ≥ 70?)
    - 3 high-quality path nodes (green)
    - 3 low-quality path nodes (orange)
    - 2 result nodes (outcomes)
  2. course-quality-workflow.js - Interactive p5.js visualization with:
    - Hover tooltips for quick descriptions
    - Detail panel showing full descriptions
    - Color-coded paths (green for high-quality, orange for low-quality)
    - Arrows showing workflow direction
    - Annotations highlighting key insights

    - Usage instructions
    - Detailed explanation of both workflow paths
    - Quality threshold information
    - Legend for colors and shapes

  Updated

  - mkdocs.yml - Added navigation entry under MicroSims section (line 101)

  Visual Design

  The infographic features:
  - Blue diamond for the decision point (Quality Score ≥ 70?)
  - Green path showing smooth workflow with quality score ≥ 70
  - Orange path showing problematic workflow with score < 70
  - Interactive hover - see detailed descriptions for each step
  - Annotations - "Quality threshold: 70+ acceptable, 85+ excellent"

  Next Steps

  To view the infographic locally:

  mkdocs serve

  Then navigate to the MicroSims section → Course Quality Workflow

  The infographic clearly demonstrates your key insight: investing time in course 
  description quality pays exponential dividends throughout the entire textbook
  generation process!
