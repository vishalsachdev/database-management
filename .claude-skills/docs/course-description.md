# Using Claude Skills to Create Intelligent Textbooks

**Title:** Using Claude Skills to Create Intelligent Textbooks
**Target Audience:** Professional development
**Reading Level:** undergrad college student

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of programming
- Basics of prompt engineering
- Anthropic Claude access
- Curiosity about using AI to build textbooks

## Course Overview

This course provides comprehensive training on leveraging Claude Skills to create intelligent, interactive textbooks that enhance learning through AI-assisted content generation. Participants will learn the complete workflow from course conception through deployment, including creating learning graphs, generating glossaries, building interactive simulations, and publishing professional educational materials.

The course emphasizes practical, hands-on skills for educators, instructional designers, and content creators who want to harness the power of AI to produce high-quality educational materials efficiently. By mastering Claude Skills and the intelligent textbook creation workflow, participants will be able to transform their subject matter expertise into engaging, pedagogically sound learning resources that adapt to modern educational needs.

Through this professional development opportunity, learners will gain expertise in both the technical aspects of working with Claude Skills and the educational design principles that make intelligent textbooks effective learning tools.

We place an emphasis on being frugal with using tokens in textbook generation.  We realize that
most teachers can't afford to pay for the Claude Code Max ($100/month) and want to built their
textbooks using the lower-cost Claude Pro ($20/month) account.  So we show how each
skill can be monitored for time and token usage and we present ideas to lower the cost of generating
textbooks and MicroSims.
