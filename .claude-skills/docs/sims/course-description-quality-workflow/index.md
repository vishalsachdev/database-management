## Overview

This interactive infographic demonstrates the critical impact of course description quality on the entire intelligent textbook generation workflow. The quality score assessed by the **course-description-analyzer** skill determines whether the project proceeds smoothly or requires extensive manual correction.

## How to Use

1. **Hover** over any node to see a brief description in the tooltip
2. **Read** the detailed information in the panel below the diagram
3. **Explore** the two workflow paths: high-quality (green) and low-quality (orange)
4. **Follow** the arrows to understand the sequence of steps in each path

## The Quality Threshold

**Quality Score ≥ 70**: The workflow proceeds smoothly with minimal manual intervention

**Quality Score < 70**: Requires significant manual correction and rework

**Quality Score ≥ 85**: Excellent quality, optimal workflow efficiency

## Workflow Paths

### High-Quality Path (Green)

When the course description achieves a quality score of 70 or higher:

1. **Learning Graph Generation** - Produces 200 relevant concepts with accurate dependencies
2. **Glossary Generation** - Creates precise, ISO 11179-compliant definitions aligned with concepts
3. **Chapter Structure** - Generates logical sequencing that respects prerequisites
4. **Result** - High-quality textbook with minimal manual correction needed

### Low-Quality Path (Orange)

When the course description scores below 70:

1. **Learning Graph Generation** - Generates generic or off-target concepts with unclear dependencies
2. **Manual Correction Required** - Significant effort needed to refine concepts and relationships
3. **Regenerate Downstream Artifacts** - Glossary and chapters must be redone with the corrected graph
4. **Result** - Extended development time (2-3x longer) with inconsistent quality

## Key Insights

!!! success "Quality Pays Exponential Dividends"
    Investing time in developing a high-quality course description (score ≥ 70) saves substantial effort throughout the entire textbook development process. The initial time investment yields returns at every subsequent step.

!!! warning "Cost of Low Quality"
    A low-quality course description creates a cascade of problems. Each downstream skill (learning graph, glossary, chapter structure, content generation) produces suboptimal output that requires manual correction and regeneration.

!!! info "Assessment Tool"
    Use the **course-description-analyzer** skill to evaluate your course description before proceeding. This skill checks for:

    - Complete title and clear audience definition
    - Well-defined prerequisites
    - Comprehensive topic coverage
    - Bloom's Taxonomy learning outcomes
    - Clarity and specificity
