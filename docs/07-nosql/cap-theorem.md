# CAP Theorem

You can only guarantee two of three:

- **C**onsistency: All nodes see same data
- **A**vailability: System responds to requests
- **P**artition tolerance: Works despite network failures

## Trade-offs

- CP: Consistent but may be unavailable
- AP: Available but may be inconsistent
- CA: Not partition tolerant (single node only)
