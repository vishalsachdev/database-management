# Relational Database Fundamentals

The relational model, introduced by Edgar F. Codd in 1970, revolutionized database management and remains the dominant paradigm today. This chapter explores the theoretical foundations and practical applications of relational databases.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter covers the core concepts of the relational database model:

- **The Relational Model** - Theoretical foundation and mathematical basis
- **Tables and Relations** - Structure and organization
- **Keys and Constraints** - Uniqueness and data validation
- **Relationships** - How tables connect to each other
- **Referential Integrity** - Maintaining data consistency across tables

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Explain the relational model and its mathematical foundation
2. Design and create tables with appropriate data types
3. Identify and define different types of keys (primary, foreign, candidate)
4. Understand and implement various types of relationships
5. Apply constraints to ensure data integrity
6. Maintain referential integrity between related tables

## Why the Relational Model?

### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Data organized in intuitive tables
- **Flexibility**: Easy to query and modify
- **Data Independence**: Logical structure separate from physical storage
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Based on set theory and relational algebra
- **Standardization**: SQL provides a universal query language

### Real-World Impact

The relational model powers:
- Banking systems
- E-commerce platforms
- Healthcare records
- Government databases
- Enterprise applications
- Web applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should understand:
- Basic database concepts (covered in Chapter 1)
- What a DBMS is and its role
- Why databases are preferable to file systems

## Getting Started

Begin with [The Relational Model](relational-model.md) to understand the theoretical foundation, then progress through each topic to build a comprehensive understanding of relational databases.
