# Database Design

Database design is the process of defining the structure, storage, and relationships of data in a database system. Good database design is crucial for data integrity, performance, and maintainability.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter covers:

- **Database Design Process** - Systematic approach to designing databases
- **Entity-Relationship Modeling** - Visual modeling of data and relationships
- **Normalization** - Organizing data to reduce redundancy
- **Normal Forms** - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF
- **Denormalization** - When and why to denormalize
- **Schema Design Best Practices** - Practical guidelines

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Follow a systematic database design process
2. Create Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams
3. Normalize databases to remove redundancy
4. Identify and apply normal forms (1NF through BCNF)
5. Understand when denormalization is appropriate
6. Apply best practices for schema design

## Why Database Design Matters

Poor database design leads to:
- Data redundancy and inconsistency
- Update anomalies
- Poor query performance
- Difficult maintenance
- Scalability issues

Good database design ensures:
- Data integrity and consistency
- Optimal performance
- Easy maintenance and modification
- Scalability
- Clear business logic representation

## Design Process Overview

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Understand what data needs to be stored
2. **Conceptual Design** - Create ER diagram
3. **Logical Design** - Convert ER to relational schema
4. **Normalization** - Remove redundancy
5. **Physical Design** - Optimize for performance
6. **Implementation** - Create actual database
